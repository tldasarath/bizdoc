              <h5 className="mt-20">1. What is the process to set up an LLC?</h5>
              <p className="mb-20">
Bizdoc handles all registration, licensing, documentation, and government approvals as part of our <a href="/business-setup-services-in-dubai" className='main-color'>business setup services in Dubai</a>.

              <h5 className="mt-20">2. Do I need a local partner for an LLC?</h5>
              <p className="mb-20">
Certain business activities may require a local partner, which we can facilitate through our network of trusted sponsors. For free zones like DMCC company setup services in Dubai and <a href="/dso-business-setup-services-in-dubai" className='main-color'>DSO business setup services in Dubai</a>, you can enjoy 100% foreign ownership.
              </p>
